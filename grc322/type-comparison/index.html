			<h1>Clarendon vs. Sutro</h1>
			<h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			<h3>Clarendon</h3>
			<!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
			<p>
				Clarendon, introduced in 1845 by Robert Besley for the Fann Street Foundry in London, marked a significant development in typography. It emerged during a time period when slab serifs were gaining popularity. Clarendon was
				designed as a "related bold" typeface, as it complements other Roman typefaces. Its patented design introduced thick, bracketed serifs, gentle curves connecting serifs to letters, and unique features like a curled leg on "R"
				and ball terminals on "a" and "c." These elements, combined with a large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, and low contrast, made Clarendon readable. Originally intended for display use, it found widespread use in
				posters, Old West "Wanted" notices, National Park signs, and inspired variations used by major brands like Sony, Wells Fargo, Tonka, and Ruby Tuesday. Clarendon's use of wood type and national park signs, allows the typeface
				to convey a sense of warmth that is timeless and comforting. The thick, square serifs convey boldness and confidence while the soft curves of the brackets add a sense of gentleness and personality.
			</p>

			<h3>Sutro</h3>
			<!-- Second typeface here. -->

			<p>
				Sutro is another slab serif designed by Jim Parkinson at Parkinson Type Design in the early 2000s. Parkinson originally designed the typeface as a simple black-and-white display type, but felt it was unfinished. Thus, he
				added layers to give it some variation, dimension, and personality. Sutro includes the primary fonts in addition to the secondary fonts – Fill, Inline Fill, Inline, and Shaded Inline. Parkinson’s vision was to create a type
				that could be stacked on top of each other to create a wide range of combinations, color, and depth. Meaning, that the secondary fonts depend on the primary fonts. In total, there are 14 different styles within the family.
				Through layering, Sutro became a versatile typeface, adding personality to a wide array of design projects.

			<h3>Similarities</h3>

			<p>
				Both Clarendon and Sutro belong to the category of slab serif typefaces, characterized by their distinctively thick, block-like serifs that set them apart from other serif styles. At first glance, these typefaces may appear
				quite similar in terms of their overall structure and visual weight.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Despite their slab serif nature, both typefaces feature similar serif shapes on these lowercase letters, maintaining a consistent x-height throughout. The dot on the lowercase "i" is notably symmetrical and of similar size
				across both typefaces.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Both Clarendon and Sutro demonstrate a shared structural approach in characters like "M" and "Q," showcasing similar stress patterns and geometric shapes with 90-degree corners. This geometric quality can make distinguishing
				between certain uppercase letters challenging. The overall shape and flow of the tail in the uppercase "Q" are notably similar between the two typefaces.
			</p>

			<h3>Differences</h3>

			<p>Clarendon was ‘born’ first and you can see how Sutro stuck with a similar structure while changing slight design elements. Overall, Sutro is more geometric with harsher angles compared to Clarendon’s soft rounded look.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>
				When comparing the lowercase “a” and “r”, you can spot slight differences between the two letters. The lowercase Clarendon “a” has a rounded terminal while the Sutro’s terminal has 90-degree corners. The overall curve to the
				upper part of the “a” has a larger arch while Sutro’s is less robust. There is a similar pattern within the tail end of both of the “a” characters, where Sutro’s geometric style has a longer tail and Clarendon’s is kept nice
				and short. The Clarendon “r” is wider in its stem, has the same curly terminal as the “a” and its intersections and corners are all fairly rounded off. Sutro’s “r” is more playful, with the same sharp angles as seen in the
				“a”, and in comparison has a thinner stem.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Clarendon’s uppercase “H” is taller than it is wide and has rounded serifs whereas Sutro’s “H” has much more of a square silhouette with its x-height and width being similar in size. Its serifs intersect at sharp angles and
				its crossbar stretches longer across. Clarendon’s uppercase “K” follows the same pattern as the “H”, “r”, and “a” with the rounded serifs and Sutro stays true to its identity by displaying sharp angles. The Clarendon “K” has
				a leg that meets its arm at a higher point, adding style, while Sutro’s leg stays more classic, meeting the arm at a point closer to the center on the stem.
